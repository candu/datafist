# datafist

is an in-browser tool for visually exploring your data.

## it is awesome because it is

- *visual:* instead of memorizing Excel functions or R commands, you use a visual editor to build visualizations of your data, which then show up instantly;
- *lightweight:* it runs right in your browser, with no server or separate hosting required;
- *open-source:* you can clone this repo and try it out, or test it via the demo link below.

## under the covers, datafist uses

- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) for visualization;
- [mootools](https://mootools.net/) for other general JavaScript-y goodness; and
- the [HTML5 File API](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/) to import data.

## inspiration for datafist came from

- [AudioMulch](http://www.audiomulch.com/), an awesome graphical audio synthesis tool;            
- [PureData](http://puredata.info/) and [Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com/products/max/), both powerful visual languages for signal processing;
- [Direct Manipulation Interfaces](http://cleo.ics.uci.edu/teaching/Winter10/231/readings/1-HutchinsHollanNorman-DirectManipulation-HCI.pdf), a classic paper on the design of intuitive interfaces; and                                        
- [FAKEGRIMLOCK](https://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2011/11/startup-is-vision.html), a fountain of poorly-Englished wisdom on entrepreneurship.
